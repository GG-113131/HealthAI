## 🧠 TumorSense – AI Brain Tumor Detection

TumorSense allows users to upload MRI images and get instant predictions using a lightweight AI model trained on brain tumor scans.

### 🧠 Model Details:

- Model Type:Convolutional Neural Network (TFLite)
- Framework:TensorFlow + Teachable Machine
- Input Size:224 x 224 pixels
- Input Format: Grayscale MRI scan
- Inference Time: ~0.3 seconds (on Render’s 0.1 CPU, 512MB RAM)

### 📋 MedLog – Health Tracker:

- MedLog is the personal health section of the app, allowing users to:
- Enter general health data (symptoms, vitals, etc.)
- Track medications (name, dosage, frequency)
- Log ongoing or past treatments
- Securely save all data using Firebase Firestore
- Authenticate with Firebase Auth (email or Google login)

---

### 📱 Mobile Version (Thunkable)

- User uploads an MRI image from their phone
- App uploads it to **Cloudinary**
- It retrieves the image URL and sends it via a `POST` request to the Flask API
- The API responds with a diagnosis and confidence score

---

### 🧪 API: `/predict`

**POST /predict**

```json
{
  "image_url": "https://link-to-mri-image.jpg"
}
```

### ✅ Sample Response:
```json
{
  "class": "Healthy",
  "confidence": 0.99897472321
}
```

### 🌐 Web Version (React + Vite, hosted on Vercel)

- Same workflow as the mobile app
- Users can upload MRI images directly from the browser
- Backend interaction via the same Flask API on Render
